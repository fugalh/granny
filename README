granny: event-based granular synthesis

Requirements: jack, liblo, libsndfile

Make >100ms wav files and put them in wavs/
(Must be 44.1kHz for now. Stereo is ok, but we only use the first channel.)
Granny will respond to OSC events /event/$(basename wavs/*.wav)

It recognizes OSC bundles, and honors bundle timestamps
(with some added internal latency)

Also responds to
/control/gain f (gain from 0-1)
/control/duration i (grain duration in milliseconds)
/control/envelope s (name of envelope - see Envelope.hh)

There is a TouchOSC UI in ui/ - TouchOSC isn't free but it's worth the $5 for
your iOS or Android device.
